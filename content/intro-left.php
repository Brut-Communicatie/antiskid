<h2>POSSEHL Antiskid®</h2>
<h3>The best solution for airports to operate more efficient, sustainable and safe.</h3>
<p>Sustainability is becoming more important and weather conditions are becoming more extreme. Critical to landing and
    takeoff safety is the traction of the landing gear tires on the runway surface. The high-friction properties of
    Antiskid® significantly reduce runway occupation time, while increasing safety and capacity and, thereby,
    profitability.

<p>Antiskid® is a rigid surface that is applied over runway asphalt. The surface layer is similar to coarse sandpaper. It consists mainly of epoxy and sharp basalt. ANTISKID® minimizes the rolling resistance and loss of traction during acceleration on wet runways, while vastly improving directional stability, in particular, in crosswinds.</p></br></br>

    <h4><strong>Did you know?</strong></h4>
    <p>Antiskid® extends the service life of the runway surfaces between five to eight years. It requires virtually no maintenance and protects the underlying asphalt, which in turn also lasts longer and requires less maintenance. Although the investment costs are higher, the life cycle costs are significantly lower.</p>
